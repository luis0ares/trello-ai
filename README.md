A modern **task management application** inspired by **Trello**, enhanced with **AI** for smart task planning.  
This project is structured as a **monorepo**, containing both **backend** and **frontend** applications.

> _Note: This is a side project developed for learning and experimentation purposes._

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Trello-like board** for organizing tasks
- ✅ **AI-powered assistant** for intelligent task creation
- ✅ **Responsive UI** optimized for desktop and mobile

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API

---

## 🤖 AI Integration

The AI assistant helps users by:

- Generating **task suggestions** based on natural language input
- **Organizing tasks** into boards automatically
- Providing **priority recommendations** for better workflow

Example:

> **User:** "Plan a marketing campaign for next month"  
> **AI:** Creates tasks like "Define target audience", "Create ad content", "Schedule social posts"
